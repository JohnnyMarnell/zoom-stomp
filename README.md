### Control Zoom MS-50g Amp + FX pedal with ...another pedal

Dynamically generate patches with configurable FX on the fly, via
Midi Message automation, e.g. from Keith McMillen Soft Step

#### Would be nice
- Start using pressure / directional pedals on SoftStep: e.g. delay feedback and time, control 2 parameters at once even
- Differentiate between a stomp and a fx nudge, try to get good intuitive motion
- Use SS display to abreviate fx names
- revisit looper, use all Node.JS, try to get intuitive, smooth beat layering
- thus plus better sounding sf2's
- Have one pedal cycle through multiple FX (e.g. multiple drives: Tube Screamer, RAT Boost, etc.)
    - I guess hold would bypass? Or off could be part of cycle...
- Control lights on SoftStep pedal (especially if toggle cycling got more advanced)
- ~Last enabled or disabled stomp press switches to that effect on Zoom screen~
- ~Turning knobs persists (store in node app memory and write to pedal memory)~
- Could write persisted + patch FX data to N other j5 patch slots for when offline mode...
- Persist cycling FX on device... (Write history as well, just in case...)
- Cycle current FX from Soft Step
